## Current status

I'm in the middle of porting fetch.js to coffeescript classes and having tests.

- [x] Finish this work.
- [ ] Test this works.

Then:

- [ ] write code to save the data somewhere.
- [ ] write code to figure out what the data means

## Running test.

On my computer I do this. `mocha --compilers coffee:coffee-script -u exports -w -r should`

- [ ] Make sure all these things are in ./node_modules/bin
- [ ] Write Makefile
